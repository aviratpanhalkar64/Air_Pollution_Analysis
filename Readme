Datasets- 
1.PM2.5 data (open.aq)
2.Landsat 8(USGS)

•	Summary -
Urban air pollution is a dynamic mixture of Land Surface Temperature (LST), gases, particulate matter with daily and seasonal changes due to anthropogenic activities.
So we decided to do comparative analysis of Land surface temperature and PM2.5 pollutant data during the period of Precovid(2019), covid(2020),Post covid(2021) for 
Bangalore district. We used data PM.25 and Landsat8 data to calculate land surface temperature. We created buffer around PM.25 location and calculate zonal statistics 
value of LST raster file (Minimum, Maximum, Mean) using QGIS. Both dataset we have joined using spatial join and created different csv file for different months, 
that all files join  by year using concat function and plotted the graph for different year. So we can easily visualize the correlation of LST and PM2.5 pollutant 
in Precovid(2019), covid(2020),Post covid(2021).

•	Methodology- 
1.We were collected data of PM2.5 for 2019,2020,2021 for the Bangalore city.
2.We were downloaded same period Landsat 8 data(Cloud cover<10%).
3.Using landsat 8 data we created LST raster file(create_py_usable.pynb)
 4.Using this raster file using zonal statistics and fishnet tool in QGIS and export that file in the form of GeoJson.
4.In jupyter lab we were import same month PM2.5 value csv file and LST value data file
5.Created buffer of every location of PM2.5.
6.That buffer dataframe and LST dataframe joined using spatial join.(2019,2020,2021_spatial_join.pynb)
7.After that we concat yearwise file and using pandas and matplotlib we created bar chart of every year for PM2.5 and LST value.(pd_concat_finaloutput.ipynb)
8.Also we calculated correlation of PM2.5 and LST value(pd_concat_finaloutput.ipynb)
9.We also created heatmap of every year (Heatmap_spatial_join_yearwise.ipynb)
Outcomes- 
we are able to see corelation between PM2.5 and LST value as well as because of lockdown period PM2.5 and LST value decreased especially in 2020 (may, July).
Correlation of every year is positive it means PM2.5 and LST relates with each other

•	Use of Geospatial Data in the project
We have used Landsat 8 data to calculate Land Surface Temperature and made 100*100 meter grid and calculate LST Minimum, Maximum and Mean value of every
grid and spatial join with PM2.5 value (Month wise).

•Improvement
Yes we will collect landsat 8 data and different pollutant data for 10 years data and apply same procedure on that data for trend analysis and correlation analysis.
